            <p>
              Suicidal and in despair, Ara (Rebekah Paltrow) is on the verge of a complete mental breakdown. Her best friend Robin (Rosario Dawson),
              takes matters into her own hands and realizes that tough love is the only way to save Ara from herself.
            </p>

              Awake is the story of a young woman and her journey of self-discovery and redemption. Filmmaker, Hunter Richards, directs the cast of this
              original short, in a timely coming of age story through darkness into a world of light.

          <div class="right">
            <p>
              Though the audience is not privy to the circumstances of Ara's pain, we see through Robin's eyes that Ara has a choice as to whether or not to
              continue suffering but needs a firm hand to guide her out of the prison of her own dark thoughts. Lead by a mystical sage (Sean Lennon) Ara
              understands how to free herself from her past, her mind, and fear.
            </p>
            <p>
              The film opens with Robin making the difficult decision to do what is best for her friend and pushing her out on to the road of self-discovery.
              We are invited to join Ara on her intense and spiritual journey of awakening.
